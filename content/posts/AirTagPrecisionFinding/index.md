How can I use AirTag's Precision Location feature?

<!--more-->
# Intro

Here's the story, I bought a bunch of AirTags, but I can't use the **Precision Location** feature in Find My App, and after a long chat with Apple Support, there is still no solution.

Apple Support had made an appointment with me for Senior Advisor the next day, but I solved the problem emojify :joy:

# Solution
## 1. Enable "Location Access Permission
See [Find the exact location of the item using "Exact Search"](https://support.apple.com/zh-hk/HT210967)

If you don't see "Find", please make sure you have enabled location access for the "Find" app:

- Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, and make sure Location Services is turned on.
- Scroll down and tap Find.
- Check "When using". To get the most accurate location, turn on "Precise Location".

## 2. Turn on location access for U1 chip

(The problem I encountered)
- Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, and make sure Location Services is turned on.
- Scroll down and click on "System Services".
- Turn on "Network & Wireless".

## 3. Locale & Device
The pinpoint search feature is only compatible with:

- iPhone 11
- iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max
- iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini
- iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max

AirTag supports Pinpoint Find for iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 series phones, but some countries such as
- Argentina
- Armenia 
- Azerbaijan
- Belarus
- Indonesia
- Kazakhstan
- Kyrgyzstan
- Nepal
- Pakistan
- Paraguay
- Russia
- Solomons
- Tajikistan
- Turkmenistan
- Ukraine
- Uzbek

Does not support U1 yet.
