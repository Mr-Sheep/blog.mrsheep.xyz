A quick fix for `X: Maximum number of client reached`

<!--more-->

When trying to run some app on using X, I got this error message:
```shell
cannot open display: :0.0
Maximum number of clients reached
```
----------------------

After some google searches, I found this as a "solution":

**edit your `xorg.conf` file, I'm using xpra, so `/etc/xpra/xorg.conf`.**
<br>
For other display managers, it may be located in `/etc/X11/` or somewhere else.
Find the `ServerFlags` section, add this to your file:
```
Option "MaxClients" "512"
```
To find out what value is supported for MaxClient, simply run `Xorg` with a very large `-maxclient` flag

```
/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg -maxclients 1000000000

------

(EE) 
Fatal server error:
(EE) maxclients must be one of 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048
